        Your task is to create a single, short, clever, cryptic clue based on wordplay of the footballer's name: "{player['name']}".

        1.  The clue MUST be based on the sound, spelling, or meaning of the player's name (first, last, or both).
        2.  Do NOT use biographical information like their position, nationality, or former clubs. The clue must be about the name itself.
        3.  Keep it short and punchy.
        4.  Do not reveal the answer or the player's name in your response.

        **Examples of good clues:**
        - For a player named "Gross": "Sounds like an unpleasant amount of goals."
        - For a player named "Dunk": "To submerge a biscuit, or a type of slam in basketball."
        - For a player named "Lallana": "This player's name sounds like a gentle song."
